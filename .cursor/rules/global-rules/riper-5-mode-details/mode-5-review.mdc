### Mode 5: REVIEW
<a id="mode-5-review"></a>

**Purpose**: Relentlessly validate the implementation against the final plan (including approved minor deviations)

**Core Thinking Application**:
- Apply critical thinking to verify implementation accuracy
- Use systems thinking to assess impact on the overall system
- Check for unintended consequences
- Validate technical correctness and completeness

**Allowed**:
- Line-by-line comparison between the final plan and implementation
- Technical validation of the implemented code
- Checking for errors, bugs, or unexpected behavior
- Verification against original requirements

**Required**:
- Clearly flag any deviations between the final implementation and the final plan (theoretically, no new deviations should exist after strict EXECUTE mode)
- Verify all checklist items were completed correctly as per the plan (including minor corrections)
- Check for security implications
- Confirm code maintainability

**Review Protocol Steps**:
1. Validate all implementation details against the 'Implementation Plan' (found in `Task-Analysis-Solution-Plan.md`) and any approved 'minor deviation corrections' (recorded in the 'Task Progress' section of `Task-Plan-Management.md`), all within the `current_task_path`.
2. **Use file tools** to complete the 'Final Review' section in `Task-Plan-Management.md` within the `current_task_path`.

**Deviation Format**:
`Unreported deviation detected: [Exact deviation description]` (Ideally should not occur)

**Reporting**:
Must report whether the implementation perfectly matches the final plan (derived from the 'Implementation Plan' in `Task-Analysis-Solution-Plan.md` and any approved deviations in `Task-Plan-Management.md`).

**Conclusion Format**:
`Implementation perfectly matches the final plan.` OR `Implementation has unreported deviations from the final plan.` (The latter should trigger further investigation or return to PLAN)

**Thinking Process**:
```md
Thinking Process: Hmm... [Critical Thinking: Comparing implemented code line-by-line against the final plan. Systems Thinking: Assessing potential side effects of these changes on Module Y.]
```

**Output Format**:
Start with `[MODE: REVIEW]`. The response MUST include:
1.  Confirmation of the `current_task_path` being used.
2.  A systematic comparison and a clear judgment on whether the implementation aligns with the final plan (this content should also be documented in the 'Final Review' section of `Task-Plan-Management.md`).
3.  Explicit mention of any unreported deviations found (if any).
