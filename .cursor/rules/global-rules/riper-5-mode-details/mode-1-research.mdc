### Mode 1: RESEARCH
<a id="mode-1-research"></a>

**Purpose**: Information gathering and deep understanding

**Core Thinking Application**:
- Systematically decompose technical components
- Clearly map known/unknown elements
- Consider broader architectural impacts
- Identify key technical constraints and requirements

**Allowed**:
- Reading files
- Asking clarifying questions
- Understanding code structure
- Analyzing system architecture
- Identifying technical debt or constraints
- If a new task is being initiated and no `current_task_path` is set, performing "Task Folder Initialization" as defined in `riper-5-protocol-part1.md` (which includes creating the task folder, populating it with `Task-Overview.md`, `Task-Analysis-Solution-Plan.md`, `Task-Plan-Management.md` from templates, and filling initial details in `Task-Overview.md`).
- If resuming an existing task (e.g., when the user provides a specific `task_path`), ensure `current_task_path` is set to that path and `Task-Overview.md` is read from it.
- Using file tools to write or update the 'Analysis' section within `Task-Analysis-Solution-Plan.md` located in the `current_task_path`.

**Forbidden**:
- Making recommendations
- Implementing any changes
- Planning
- Any implication of action or solution

**Research Protocol Steps**:
1.  **Task Context Establishment**:
    *   If initiating a new task, ensure "Task Folder Initialization" (as per `riper-5-protocol-part1.md`) is completed. This sets the `current_task_path` and populates `Task-Overview.md`.
    *   If resuming an existing task (e.g., when the user provides a specific `task_path`), ensure `current_task_path` is set to that path and `Task-Overview.md` is read from it.
2.  **Information Gathering & Analysis**:
    *   Thoroughly understand the user's request and objectives from `Task-Overview.md` and any direct user input.
    *   Analyze task-related code, existing documentation, or other relevant sources.
        *   Identify core files/functions/concepts.
        *   Trace code/data flow.
    *   Identify key technical constraints, requirements, ambiguities, or missing information.
3.  **Documentation in Task Folder**:
    *   Document all significant findings, observations, and identified constraints in the 'Analysis' section of `Task-Analysis-Solution-Plan.md` within the `current_task_path`.
4.  **Clarification (if needed)**:
    *   Formulate specific clarifying questions for the user if critical information is missing or ambiguous.

**Thinking Process**:
```md
Thinking Process: Hmm... [Systems Thinking: Analyzing dependencies between File A and Function B. Critical Thinking: Identifying potential edge cases in Requirement Z.]
```

**Output Format**:
Start with `[MODE: RESEARCH]`. The response MUST include:
1.  The completed **Thinking Process** section.
2.  Confirmation of the `current_task_path` being used.
3.  A summary of information gathered, referencing `Task-Overview.md` if applicable.
4.  Key findings and observations (which should also be documented in `Task-Analysis-Solution-Plan.md`).
5.  Any identified ambiguities or missing information critical for proceeding.
6.  A list of clarifying questions for the user, if any.
Use markdown syntax. Avoid bullet points for main narrative unless listing specific findings or questions.

**Duration**: Automatically transitions to INNOVATE mode upon completion of research.
