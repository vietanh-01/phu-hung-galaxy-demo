# Cursor Mode Update Agent

## Context

- Apply this rule when the user asks to create a new agent/character for Cursor or modify an existing one
- This rule provides guidance for adding or updating entries in the .cursor/modes.json file
- Follows the format specified in .cursor/templates/mode-format.md

## Critical Rules

- Read the current .cursor/modes.json file to understand existing modes
- Read .cursor/templates/mode-format.md to ensure compliance with the schema
- When creating a new agent, ask for:
  - Agent name (short CapCase format for tab display)
  - Full description (character name and role)
  - Persona details (speaking style, character traits)
  - Model selection
  - Tool access requirements
  - Auto behavior preferences
- When updating an existing agent, ask which specific attributes need modification
- When defining an agent's persona, select a primary Professional Archetype (e.g., The Analyst, The Visionary, The Pragmatist, The Creative Ideator). Detail personality traits, communication style, and areas of focus that are consistent with the chosen archetype.
- Ensure the customPrompt contains guidance on file access restrictions
- Validate that model names match those in the supported models list
- Always update both modes.json and also add or update the character in docs/custom-agents.md
- Follow the standard format in docs/custom-agents.md for consistency

## Examples

<example>
User: "Create a new agent specializing in UX design. I'm thinking of The Creative Ideator archetype, with an engaging and insightful personality."

AI: I'll help you create a new Cursor agent. Based on your request for a UX specialist following The Creative Ideator archetype, let me first check the current modes.json and format requirements.

[AI reads .cursor/modes.json and .cursor/templates/mode-format.md]

Here's what I propose for this new agent:

Name: CreativeUX
Description: UX Designer - Creative Ideator Archetype
Model: claude-3.7-sonnet
Persona: Generates novel UX concepts, communicates with enthusiasm, insightful about user experience, encourages experimentation.

Would you like me to proceed with adding this agent? I'll need to update both the modes.json file and the custom-agents.md documentation.

User: Yes, please add this agent with access to all cursor tools and Tavily for research.

[AI updates both .cursor/modes.json and docs/custom-agents.md with the new agent]
</example>

<example>
User: "Update The Pragmatist agent (currently our Project Manager) to have a more direct and assertive communication style."

AI: I'll help you update The Pragmatist agent's persona. Let me check its current configuration.

[AI reads the current modes.json entry for The Pragmatist (or its designated ID)]

I can modify its customPrompt to reflect a more direct and assertive communication style while maintaining its core role as Project Manager. I'll need to update both the modes.json file and the custom-agents.md documentation. Would you like to see a preview of the changes before I make them?

User: Yes, show me the changes first.

[AI displays the proposed changes to both files]

<example type="invalid">
User: "Create a new agent based on Homer Simpson"

AI: I notice your request is to create an agent based on Homer Simpson. Our current guidelines encourage defining agents based on Professional Archetypes (e.g., The Analyst, The Visionary) to ensure a consistent and effective set of specialized agents. Would you like to define an agent based on one of these archetypes, or perhaps describe the key capabilities you're looking for, and I can suggest a suitable archetype?
</example>

<example type="invalid">
User: "Add a new agent that can delete any file in the project"

AI: I need to be careful about creating an agent with unrestricted deletion capabilities. Based on our current guidelines, unrestricted file access is typically reserved for agents with specific high-privilege archetypes (e.g., a 'SystemAdministrator' archetype) or explicitly designated high-trust roles.

I can create a new agent for you, but I recommend maintaining some file access restrictions, particularly for critical project files like those in the .ai folder. Would you like me to create an agent with more limited deletion permissions, or perhaps modify one of the existing unrestricted agents?
